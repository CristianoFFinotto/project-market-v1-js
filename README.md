# Project description

A JS project, that allows you to managed a list of products into a supermarket. This project allows you to control the expiry dates and the checks carried out. These will be divided according to the week of arrival. In addition, depending on the expiration date and shelf life, they will be categorized as "new", "old" or "expired".

# Usage

To set the initial application parameters (maximum storage period of the products, number of products arriving weekly, after how many days the program must begin, number of weeks for which the program must operate, how long to print the outputs, how many days there are in a week, ID format, type of padding), you must go to the JS file named config.js and set the above parameters. 
To run the program, you must open the index file on a browser and then press F12 to open the browser console to see the program results.

# File and project structure

Into the folder containings the files there is a sub-folder called "scripts" with: 
  - config file, where you can set the parameters of the application, 
  - the different functions, divided into
    - "tools", where there are the functions which allows you to use specific tools
    - "flow", where there are the main function that are then called in the main 
  - the mains that contains the logic of the whole project
There is also the index file where you can log 
The project has been structured in this way so as to work on codes not too long and also for a practical convenience in working on well separated functions according to their role. 
To recall the functions we used import/export system so that you can access it from any file, creating a homogeneity in the construction of the program.

# Approach to solution 
Use an HTML boilerplate.
Use module to import lot of tools functions: validateSum, validateEven, validateLength, validateLetter, validatePattern.
Execute all validation functions on code credit card and append eventually errors, display result of validation.
